Estimating Instantaneous Energy 
================================

Collection of M-files (computer code) to implement instantaneous energy measures, including the "nonlinear energy operator", as
described in [[1]](#references).
Requires Matlab or Octave programming environments.

# overview
Implements methods to estimate frequency-weighted instantaneous energy.  Implements the
Teager–Kaiser operator, often referred to as the nonlinear energy operator, and a similar
frequency-weight operator proposed in reference [[1]](#references). The Teager–Kaiser operator is
simply defined, for discrete signal x(n), as
```
Ψ[x(n)] = x²(n) - x(n+1)x(n-1)
```  
and the proposed energy measure is defined as
```
 Γ[x(n)] = y²(n) + H[y(n)]²
```
where y(n) is the derivative of x(n), estimated using the central-finite difference
equation y(n)=[x(n+1)-x(n-1)]/2, and H[·] is the discrete Hilbert transform of x(n).  Reference [[1]](#references) contains more details.


# quick start

The following example generates the Teager–Kaiser operator and the proposed
envelope–derivative operator for a test signal (sum of two sinusoidals signals),
cut-and-paste the following code into Matlab (or Octave):
```matlab
  % generate two sinusoidal signals:
  N=256; n=0:N-1;
  w1=pi/(N/32); ph1=-pi+2*pi*rand(1,1);  a1=1.3;
  w2=pi/(N/8); ph2=-pi+2*pi*rand(1,1);  a2=3.1;
  x1=a1.*cos(w1.*n + ph1);  x2=a2.*cos(w2.*n + ph2);
  x=x1+x2;

  % compute instantaneous energy:
  x_env_diff=cal_freqweighted_energy(x,1,'envelope_diff');
  x_teager  =cal_freqweighted_energy(x,1,'teager');

  % plot:
  figure(1); clf; 
  subplot(211); hold all; plot(x); ylabel('amplitude');
  subplot(212); hold all; plot(x_env_diff,'-'); plot(x_teager,'--');
  ylabel('energy');
  legend('envelope-derivative','Teager-Kaiser');
```


## properties
To test the properties of the operators with some example signals, call
`properties_test_Hilbert_NLEO(number)` with argument `number` either 0,1,2,3, or 4. For
example, 
```matlab
  >> properties_test_Hilbert_NLEO(3);
```
calls the function with frequency modulated signal with instantaneous frequency law of
0.1+0.3sin(tπ/N).

## noise analysis
To compare the bias for each method, run the function
```matlab
  >> bias_of_estimators;
```
which computes the mean-value (and therefore an approximation to the Expectation operator)
of 10,000 iterations of white Gaussian noise. This then produces Fig. 2 in the ‘Noise
Analysis’ section of [[1]](#references).


# files
All Matlab files (.m files) have a description and an example in the header. To read this
header, type `help <filename.m>` in Matlab.  Directory structure is as follows: 
```
